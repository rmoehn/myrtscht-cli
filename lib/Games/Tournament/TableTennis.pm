=head1 NAME

Games::Tournament::TableTennis - Perl extension for managing round robins

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Games::Tournament::TableTennis;
  # and do something useful with it

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module has currently no real common use. It is currently just
used to bring the main functions out of B<myrtscht|myrtscht>, the
actually most important part of this distribution, and thus make it
lighter. Hence I haven't documented this module yet. But I will do
this in the next time and in the time after the next time I will be
working on more commonly useful functions of
L<Games::Tournament::TableTennis|Games::Tournament::TableTennis>.


=head1 NOTE

Since this module is not yet designed for common use I do not
recommend to used it yourself if you do not know exactly what you do.
Rather look on L<myrtscht|myrtscht> (also included in this
distribution) and visit
L<Games::Tournament::TableTennis|Games::Tournament::TableTennis from
time to time.
