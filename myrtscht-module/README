myrtscht version 0.02 - README
==============================

myrtscht is a tool to manage round robins. But I think, one can also
use it for other games if they do not allow standoffs.

myrtscht is completely command line oriented, but (as I think) easy to
use. Maybe I will provide a GUI, but don't rely on that or wait a long
time.

As you can see, the version number is not really high yet, but I
think, myrtscht is already usable. In the next time the development
will concentrate more on things, that are not user-seeable. Thus
operating will not change significantly.
