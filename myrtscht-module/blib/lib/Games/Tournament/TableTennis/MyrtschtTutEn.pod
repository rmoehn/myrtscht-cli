Games::Tournament::Myrtscht::TutDe - A tutorial to B<myrtscht>


=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Since all the stuff in the embedded documentation of B<myrtscht> is
very theoretical, I will give a big example of the order of events in
a tournament.  You can see this part also as a tutorial which makes
getting used to B<myrtscht> easy.


=head1 A BIG EXAMPLE or TUTORIAL (as you like it)

So let us start: Imagine, we are the organizers of a yearly table
tennis tournament and we have heard of B<myrtscht>.  Luckily we have a
computer, we install the program and look forward to the event first
time, as it will not become such tremendous arduous like the last
years because of having B<myrtscht>.  Unfortunately the person
responsible for advertising has become ill and now there are just
eleven persons to play.  Whatever! Iulius Caesar is here and we do not
want to disappoint him.

But now let's begin working with our new tool!

First we init the tournament:

    $ myrtscht -n Aremorican_Open-50BC -g 2
    $ cd Aremorican_Open-50BC
    $ ls
    01.g  02.g

There have four women and seven men registered at our table, so we
make two groups out of them.  (See! We were such foresighted, that we
have created just two group files.)

    $ vim 01.g          # of course we use vim(1)
    $ cat 01.g
    Name: Women
    Tables: 1
    Impedimenta
    Mrs Fulliautomatix
    Bravura
    Bacteria
    $ vim 02.g
    $ cat 02.g
    Name: Men
    Tables: 2, 3
    Asterix
    Obelix
    Gaius Iulius Caesar
    Gaius Bonus
    Anticlimax
    Edifis
    Dogmatix

We have already set up our printer, so we can start creating the group
directories immediately.  The only thing is that it is not the
standard.  So we have to define it explicitely:

    $ myrtscht -p *.g -P GS-Printfix-50BC
    $ ls
    01.d  02.d
    $ ls *.d
    01.d:
    01.g  01.s  02.s  03.s  04.s  05.s  06.s    

    02.d:
    01.s  03.s  06.s  09.s  12.s  15.s  18.s  21.s
    02.g  04.s  07.s  10.s  13.s  16.s  19.s
    02.s  05.s  08.s  11.s  14.s  17.s  20.s

Now we have two possibilities: Either we give the whole gamesheets to
the referees, relax now and have some hurry later, or we cut the
gamesheets into the parts belonging to just one game, relax never
because of continuous getting of little slips and have not so much hurry
afterwards.

Whatever, when the referees have got the gamesheets the playing can
start, they can write the results on the paper easily and we have
just the job to write it into the computer.  I recommend doing this in
vim(1) and with tabs:

    $ vim -p 01.d/*.s
    $ cat 01.d/*.s
    Impedimenta | Mrs Fulliautomatix
    11  4
    11  8
    Bacteria | Bravura
    11  8
    10  12
    11  9
    Impedimenta | Bravura
    11  4
    11  3
    Bacteria | Mrs Fulliautomatix
    14  16
    12  10
    18  20
    Impedimenta | Bacteria
    11  7
    5   11
    9   11
    Bravura | Mrs Fulliautomatix
    3   11
    8   11
    $ vim -p 02.d/*.s
    # I leave the "cat" out here. It needs too much space and food with
    # two of them.

=head3 Note:

Thanks to the ID on the game sheets it is very easy to discover the
related game file.  The first two digits are synonymous with the
number of the group directory, the last two to three with the number
of the game file.

=head4 Example:

        04.s
         /\
   ID: 0304   ==> vim 03.d/04.s
       \/
      03.d

As soon as we have done this, we are very anxious to know the results:

    $ myrtscht -a 01.d
    $ cat 01.d/ranking
    Rank | Name                  |  Games  |   Sets    |  SD  |    Balls    |  BD
    -----+-----------------------+---------+-----------+------+-------------+------

      2. | Bacteria              |  2 : 1  |   5 : 4   |  1   |  105 : 100  |   5
      3. | Mrs Fulliautomatix    |  2 : 1  |   4 : 3   |  1   |   80 : 77   |   3
      4. | Bravura               |  0 : 3  |   1 : 6   |  -5  |   47 : 76   |  -29
    $ cd 02.d
    $ myrtscht -a *.s
    $ cat ranking
    Rank | Name                  |  Games  |   Sets    |  SD  |    Balls    |  BD

      1. | Anticlimax            |  6 : 0  |  12 : 0   |  12  |  140 : 104  |  36
      2. | Asterix               |  5 : 1  |  10 : 3   |  7   |  148 : 105  |  43
      3. | Edifis                |  4 : 2  |   8 : 5   |  3   |  134 : 108  |  26
      4. | Gaius Iulius Caesar   |  3 : 3  |   7 : 7   |  0   |  134 : 116  |  18
      5. | Obelix                |  2 : 4  |   5 : 9   |  -4  |  123 : 150  |  -27
      6. | Dogmatix              |  1 : 5  |   4 : 10  |  -6  |  118 : 134  |  -16
      7. | Gaius Bonus           |  0 : 6  |   0 : 12  | -12  |   52 : 132  |  -80

Very good!  The tournament is over.---Let's turn the computer off and
celebrate a bit!

    $ su -c 'shutdown -h now'


=head1 NOTE

My name is written with "o umlaut", but perldoc(1) doesn't like the
correct spelling.  If you want to see the correct spelling use
S<C<pod2man --utf8 myrtscht | nroff -Tlatin1 -man | less>> instead of
running perldoc!
