This is the suspended version of the program myrtscht. I decided to
rewrite it and make it a GUI program. (See also the website.) I am
keeping the repository just for those who are interested and for maybe
continuing the development of an alternative CLI.

NOTE: This repository is somehow messy as I was not very familiar to
git when I created it.
